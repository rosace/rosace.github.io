        <h4>Algorithm</h4>
        <p> function drawBall() {  </p>
    <p>noStroke();</p>
    <p>fill(25, 200, 500);</p>
    <p>ellipse(ballX, 200, 20, 20);</p>
    <p>ellipse(200, ballY, 20, 20);</p>
    <p>ellipse(ballX, ballY, 20, 20);
}</p>

<p>The purpose of this block of code is to draw the three
blue balls that show up on the screen. When this code runs
correctly, it draws three balls the same size as each other.
The algorithm is able to achieve this result by using 
ellipse to position and control the size of the three balls.
It also uses fill to add color to all three of the balls. 
If this program did not include this algorithm, the blue 
background would not be able to change to different colors. 
This algorithm works with the move function to make sure
the three balls are able to move around in the screen.</p>



<h4>Abstraction</h4>

<p> function draw() {</p>
<p> background(BG); </p>
<p> Background(); </p>
<p> stroke(0); </p>
<p> line(width / 2, 0, width / 2, height); </p>
<p> line(0, height / 2, width, height / 2); </p>
<p> drawBall(); </p>
<p>move(); </p>
<p> CheckBounderies();} </p>

<p>An example of an abstraction in my program is the
Draw(); function. This simplifies my program by calling
all the previous steps which include drawing the balls,
moving, and checking the boundaries into one place. 
This way I have all the parts that make the program run
in one single are reducing the code into simple steps.
I created this function to avoid having a messy code 
and be able to single out any bugs because it is easier
to tell if one step is not working and were I can find 
and change the code without breaking it. If this 
abstraction was not present, then there would be no
balls and they would not be able to move because even
though I have the code for each of the steps without
calling them in this draw function they would not 
appear on the screen.
