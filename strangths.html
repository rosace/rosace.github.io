       <h3>Organizer</h3>
       <p>Making lists and planing things out is what I enjoy doing. this
       creat order and is relaxing because everything falls into place.
       </p>
       <p>I see this theme in my life come up very often without me
       even knowing. One example that comes up constently is
       organizing shelfs at stores. Whenever I'm at stores
       and I see one or even the whole shelf unorganized I have a 
       tendency to organize it. Another example of this theme
       in my life is creating lists. Whatever I do I usally have
       a list of the things I'm going to do, the time I'll take
       to do it, and when I should move on to the next task.</p>
       <p>I am very focused and even though I dislike math I end
       up using some basic math when creating my lists.
       organizing makes me more relaxed and more confident in 
       what I will be doing. It also makes me feel more productive.</p>
       <p>How I can use this strangth:</p>
       <ul>
           <li>Organizing for clubs</li>
           <li>Big projects</li>
       </ul>
       
       <h3>Future Thinker</h3>
       <p> I like to think about things that could happen in the
       future from a few days to a few years. I'm not usally tied down by facts
       and use imagination a lot. I think about my own future but also
       about the future of people (and things) around me. </p>
       <p>One way I see this theme in my life is when I talk to my
       sister. Whenever we talk something about the future comes up.
       We talk about new inventions and diffrent ways of living
       for people in the future.</p>
       <p>I feel excited and sometimes a little bit worried for 
       the world about what might happen to it. Excited because 
       there are a lot of possabilities. </p>
       <ul>
           <li>Write books</li>
           <li>Comeing up with new ideas</li>
       </ul>
       
       <h3>Dependability</h3>
       <p>Being asked to do something that is important, to me, means that 
       I am being trusted. Being trusted is very important to me and I 
       enjoy being responsable for something because it gives me a
       chance to show how trustworthy I can be. I also always keep
       my promises</p>
       <p>One way I see this theme in my life is in school. When I
       am asked to do something in class I try my best to do it. 
       In this way I build trust so people know that I can be
       tursted and thats something I really value</p>
       <p>I feel really excited when I gain the trust of someone
       but also a little poressured. I want to be able to have
       the advice and to protect the people that have put their
       trust in me.</p>
