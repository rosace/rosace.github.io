	The computing innovation I chose is 3D printers. 
	The purpose of 3D printers is to be able to build
	different objects with less material than with 
	regular manufacturing methods. It works by printing
	out layers and stacking them one on top of the other.
	The idea is that once you have all the layers stacked
	in the right places it will create a object thats 3D. 
	This artifact shows 3D printers and the types of objects
	that can be created by them.

To learn information on this topic I used the google 
search engine to find sources that I could use for this
project. The program I used to create this artifact is
GIMP Image Editor. First, I collected some images of 3D
printers and the objects that can be made by 3D printers.
Then, I took all the images and compiled them into a 
document on GIMP Image Editor. After that, I added a title
and a short explanation on what the purpose of 3D printers are.</p>

<h4>Response 2c</h4>
<p>
The impact on society is that it offers a new way of
manufacturing items without the need for multiple 
machines. One benefit of this innovation is that 
a variety of different objects can be created by 
one single machine. (1) This means that instead 
of having a bunch of machines helping to create 
on single object you have one creating multiple 
useful items. This innovation will have a beneficial
impact on our culture because it will change the
way we build things and allow us to use different
types of materials to make things we couldnâ€™t have
before.(3) On the other hand, this innovation is 
harmful because the fumes that 3D printers release
can be dangerous. These fumes could be potential 
carcinogen which can cause cancer.(2) Now that the 
use of 3D printers is on the rise many people that
use these machines could die causing a strain on 
the economy.</p>

<h4>Response 2d</h4>
<p>
The data my innovation uses are models of 3D objects.
The 3D models of these objects are stored into CDA files.
The data is used by the 3D printers in order to add all
the layers in the right places so that the product can 
be made successfully. In other words they use the models
as a blueprint to build the object. A concern about 
security is that 3D printers can be used to make 
counterfeit items. 3D printers do not really need any
top secret information on a product to make it. They 
could just use the product itself as a model and the 
3D printer could make one with no problem. This is bad 
news for both  companies because the companies are not 
gaining any money for the product that is rightfully 
theirs and may even lose money because consumers are 
getting their products from other sources.</p>
